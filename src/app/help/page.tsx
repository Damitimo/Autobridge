      question: 'How much does it cost to import a car?',
      answer: 'Total cost depends on the vehicle price, shipping method, and customs duties. Our AI calculator gives you the exact landed cost before you bid. Typically, for a $10,000 car, total landed cost in Nigeria is â‚¦18-22 million.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the process take?',
      answer: 'From winning the bid to delivery in Nigeria takes 6-10 weeks on average. This includes: auction payment (1-2 days), towing and documentation (3-7 days), shipping (4-6 weeks), customs clearance (3-7 days), and final delivery (1-3 days).',
    },
    {
      question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
      answer: 'We accept bank transfers and card payments in Nigerian Naira. We work with Paystack and Flutterwave for secure payments. Funds are held in escrow until your vehicle ships from the U.S.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to pay upfront?',
      answer: 'No. You only pay after winning the auction. We require 50% deposit within 24 hours of winning, and the balance before the vehicle ships from the U.S. port.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the car has hidden damage?',
      answer: 'All vehicles come with detailed condition reports and photos from the auction. We also offer optional pre-purchase inspection ($150) where our agent physically inspects the vehicle before you bid.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I inspect the car before bidding?',
      answer: 'You can see detailed photos and condition reports from the auction. For high-value vehicles, we offer paid inspection services where our U.S. agent physically checks the vehicle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do customs duties work?',
      answer: 'Nigerian customs duties are calculated based on vehicle age, engine size, and type. Our calculator uses the official Nigerian Customs tariff to show exact duty amounts before you bid.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you handle PAAR/SONCAP?',
      answer: 'Yes! We handle all Nigerian import requirements including PAAR, SONCAP certification, and vehicle clearance. All costs are included in our calculator.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I don\'t win the auction?',
      answer: 'If you don\'t win, there\'s no charge. You can place bids on unlimited vehicles. We only charge when you win and we successfully import your vehicle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Where do you deliver in Nigeria?',
      answer: 'We deliver nationwide. Lagos and Port Harcourt deliveries are included in the base price. For other states, there\'s a small additional fee shown in the calculator.',
    },
