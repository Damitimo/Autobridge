# MVP Implementation Guide - Using Web Scraping

## Overview

This guide explains how to launch AutoBridge MVP using web scraping to get vehicle data from Copart, with a hybrid approach for bidding.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: What Scraping CAN and CANNOT Do

### ‚úÖ What Scraping CAN Do:
- Get public vehicle listings (make, model, year, price)
- Scrape vehicle images
- Get auction locations and dates
- Update current bid amounts
- Track vehicle status

### ‚ùå What Scraping CANNOT Do:
- Place actual bids (requires authentication)
- Access your account data
- Get real-time updates (need to poll)
- Bypass CAPTCHAs automatically
- Guarantee 100% uptime (site changes break it)

---

## The Hybrid MVP Approach

Since you can't automate bidding with scraping, here's the workflow:

### User Flow:
1. **User browses vehicles** ‚Üí Your platform (scraped data)
2. **User selects vehicle** ‚Üí Places bid intent in your system
3. **User pays deposit** ‚Üí Money held in escrow
4. **You manually place bid** ‚Üí Log into Copart portal
5. **Auction happens** ‚Üí Copart decides winner
6. **You update status** ‚Üí Mark as won/lost in system
7. **User gets notified** ‚Üí Via email/SMS/WhatsApp

### Why This Works for MVP:
- ‚úÖ Test market demand quickly
- ‚úÖ Low initial cost (~$0 tech cost)
- ‚úÖ Validate pricing model
- ‚úÖ Build user base
- ‚úÖ Generate revenue to fund API migration

## Setup Instructions (1 Hour)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 min)

```bash
cd /Users/AlphaFox/Downloads/AI\ Projects/autobridge

# Install cheerio for HTML parsing
npm install cheerio

# Install types
npm install -D @types/cheerio

# Install tsx for running TypeScript scripts
npm install -D tsx
```

### Step 2: Update Database Schema (10 min)

The schema is already updated with external bid tracking fields. Run migration:

```bash
# Generate migration
npm run db:generate

# Review the generated migration file
# It should add: externalBidId, externalSource, externalStatus, lastSyncedAt

# Apply migration
npm run db:migrate
```

### Step 3: Test the Scraper (15 min)

```bash
# Test if scraping works
npx tsx -e "import { testScraper } from './src/lib/copart-scraper'; testScraper()"
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Scraper working! Found 5 vehicles
```

**If it fails:**
- Copart may have updated their HTML structure
- You may be rate limited
- Network/firewall blocking request

**Fix:** You'll need to inspect Copart's current HTML and update the selectors in `copart-scraper.ts`

### Step 4: Run Initial Vehicle Sync (20 min)

```bash
# Manually sync vehicles
npx tsx src/jobs/sync-vehicles-scraper.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
üîÑ Starting vehicle sync...
üìä Scraping Toyota vehicles...
Found 50 Toyota vehicles
  ‚úì Added: 2018 Toyota Camry
  ‚úì Added: 2019 Toyota Corolla
  ...
‚úÖ Sync complete!
  - New vehicles: 120
  - Errors: 2
```

**Check database:**
```bash
# View vehicles in database
npm run db:studio
# Open http://localhost:4983
# Check 'vehicles' table
```

### Step 5: Start Auto-Sync (10 min)

Add to your main server file:

```typescript
// src/app/api/cron/route.ts or your server startup

import { scheduleVehicleSync } from '@/jobs/sync-vehicles-scraper';

// Start on server launch
scheduleVehicleSync();
```

Or use a cron job:
```bash
# Add to crontab (run every 30 minutes)
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/autobridge && npx tsx src/jobs/sync-vehicles-scraper.ts
```

## Bid Workflow - Manual Process

### For Users (Frontend):

1. **Browse vehicles** - Works automatically with scraped data
2. **Click "Place Bid"** - Collects bid intent
3. **Pay deposit** - Via Paystack (10-20% of bid)
4. **Wait for auction** - 24-48 hours typically
5. **Get notification** - Win/loss alert

### For You (Admin):

#### Daily Routine (30-60 min/day):

1. **Check pending bids dashboard**
   ```
   GET /api/bids/pending
   ```
   
2. **Log into Copart.com**
   - Use your existing account
   
3. **Place each bid manually**
   - Navigate to lot number
   - Place proxy bid up to max amount
   - Note Copart's bid confirmation number
   
4. **Mark as placed in your system**
   ```
   PUT /api/bids/{id}/placed
   Body: { copartBidId: "COPART-123456" }
   ```

5. **After auction ends**
   - Check results on Copart
   - Update status in your system
   - Notify users

#### Build Admin Dashboard:

```typescript
// src/app/admin/bids/page.tsx

export default async function AdminBidsPage() {
  // Fetch pending bids
  const response = await fetch('/api/bids/pending');
  const { data: pendingBids } = await response.json();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Pending Bids - Need Manual Placement</h1>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>User</th>
            <th>Vehicle</th>
            <th>Max Bid</th>
            <th>Lot Number</th>
            <th>Auction Date</th>
            <th>Actions</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {pendingBids.map(item => (
            <tr key={item.bid.id}>
              <td>{item.user.firstName} {item.user.lastName}</td>
              <td>{item.vehicle.year} {item.vehicle.make} {item.vehicle.model}</td>
              <td>${item.bid.maxBidAmount}</td>
              <td>
                <a 
                  href={`https://www.copart.com/lot/${item.vehicle.lotNumber}`}
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  {item.vehicle.lotNumber}
                </a>
              </td>
              <td>{formatDate(item.vehicle.auctionDate)}</td>
              <td>
                <button onClick={() => markAsPlaced(item.bid.id)}>
                  Mark as Placed
                </button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Limitations & Workarounds

### Limitation 1: Rate Limiting

**Problem:** Copart blocks after ~50-100 requests

**Workarounds:**
- Sync only popular makes
- Run sync every 30-60 min (not every 5 min)
- Use residential proxy if needed
- Cache vehicle data aggressively

### Limitation 2: Site Changes

**Problem:** HTML structure changes break scraper

**Workarounds:**
- Monitor sync job logs daily
- Have fallback: show users Copart link
- Plan to migrate to API within 3 months
- Keep scraper code modular for easy updates

### Limitation 3: Manual Bidding

**Problem:** You have to place each bid manually

**Workarounds:**
- Batch process: place all bids once per day
- Set expectations: "Bids placed within 24 hours"
- Charge premium for same-day bidding
- Hire VA to handle this ($5-10/hour)

### Limitation 4: No Real-time Updates

**Problem:** Can't get instant auction results

**Workarounds:**
- Check Copart portal 2-3x per day
- Set calendar reminders for auction dates
- Update users within 2-4 hours of auction end
- Automate status checks once you get API

---

## Scaling Strategy

### Month 1-2: MVP (Manual)
- 10-20 users
- 30-50 bids/month
- You handle all bids manually
- **Cost:** ~$0/month
- **Time:** 1-2 hours/day

### Month 3-4: Semi-Automated
- 50-100 users
- 100-200 bids/month
- Hire part-time VA for bid placement
- **Cost:** ~$500/month (VA)
- **Time:** 30 min/day (you supervise)

### Month 5-6: Full API
- 200+ users
- 500+ bids/month
- Migrate to AutoData Direct or Copart API
- **Cost:** ~$300-500/month (API)
- **Time:** Fully automated

---

## Migration Path to Official API

When you're ready to migrate (recommended at 50+ monthly bids):

### Step 1: Sign up for AutoData Direct
- Cost: $300/month
- Setup: 1-3 days
- No code changes needed (just swap the client)

### Step 2: Update One Line
```typescript
// From:
import { createCopartScraper } from '@/lib/copart-scraper';
const client = createCopartScraper();

// To:
import { createCopartClient } from '@/lib/copart-api';
const client = createCopartClient(); // Uses API instead
```

### Step 3: Enable Auto-Bidding
- Update bid workflow to call API
- Remove manual placement step
- Enjoy automated bidding!

## Troubleshooting

### "Scraper not finding vehicles"

**Causes:**
- Copart updated their HTML
- Rate limited
- Network issues

**Fixes:**
1. Check scraper logs
2. Visit Copart.com manually and inspect HTML
3. Update selectors in `copart-scraper.ts`
4. Add delays between requests
5. Use different IP/proxy

### "Can't place bids"

**Reminder:** Scraping cannot place bids. You must:
1. Log into Copart manually
2. Navigate to lot
3. Place bid manually
4. Mark as placed in your system

### "Vehicle images not loading"

**Causes:**
- Image URLs expired
- Copart changed image hosting

**Fixes:**
1. Update image URL parsing in scraper
2. Download and host images yourself (better)
3. Use placeholder images as fallback

---

## Security Considerations

### For Scraping:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Respect robots.txt
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit yourself (2-5 sec delays)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't hammer their servers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Have fallback for when blocked

### For User Data:
- ‚úÖ Encrypt sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS everywhere
- ‚úÖ KYC verification before bids
- ‚úÖ Escrow payments securely
- ‚úÖ Clear terms of service
