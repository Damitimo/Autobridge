# Your Action Plan - With Existing Copart Account

## Great News! 🎉

Since you already have a Copart account with login credentials, you're in an excellent position to launch AutoBridge quickly. This is **much better** than starting from scratch.

---

## Your Immediate Next Steps

### Today (30 minutes):

#### Step 1: Verify Your Account Type
1. Log into https://www.copart.com
2. Go to your account settings/profile
3. Check what type of account you have:
   - ✅ **Dealer/Broker** = Perfect! You can bid for clients
   - ⚠️ **Member** = Personal only, needs upgrade
   - ❌ **Basic** = Need to upgrade

4. Look for these details:
   - Dealer Number (if you have one)
   - Account standing (active/good standing?)
   - Deposit balance

#### Step 2: Contact Copart for API Access
**Call:** +1-972-391-5000  
**Ask for:** API access for your dealer account

**Say this:**
> "Hi, I have a dealer account (or member account) with Copart and I'm building a platform to help my clients in Nigeria bid on vehicles. I need API access to pull vehicle data and place bids programmatically. Can you help me get API credentials?"

**What to request:**
- API Key
- API endpoint URLs
- Documentation
- Rate limits
- Any special permissions needed for international clients

**Timeline:** Usually 1-5 business days

## While Waiting for API Access (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Prepare Your Database

#### Update Database Schema:
```bash
cd /Users/AlphaFox/Downloads/AI\ Projects/autobridge

# Generate new migration with external bid tracking
npm run db:generate

# Review the migration file
# It should add: externalBidId, externalSource, externalStatus, lastSyncedAt to bids table

# Apply migration
npm run db:migrate
```

#### What Changed:
I've already updated `src/db/schema.ts` to add these columns to track Copart bids:
- `externalBidId` - Stores Copart's bid reference
- `externalSource` - Tracks if it's from Copart or IAAI
- `externalStatus` - Raw status from Copart
- `lastSyncedAt` - When we last checked with Copart

### Day 2-3: Set Up Environment

#### Update Your .env File:
```bash
# Copy example if you haven't
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Copart credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

Add these lines (I've already updated .env.example):
```env
# Your Copart Account
COPART_USERNAME=your_copart_username
COPART_PASSWORD=your_copart_password
COPART_DEALER_NUMBER=your_dealer_number_if_any

# Will get these from Copart support:
COPART_API_KEY=will_get_from_copart
COPART_API_URL=will_get_from_copart
```

### Day 3-4: Review Integration Code

I've created these files for you:

1. **`src/lib/copart-api.ts`** - Main API client (template)
   - Review this
   - You'll customize it once you get Copart's API docs

2. **`scripts/test-copart-connection.ts`** - Test script
   - Will use this once you have API access
   - Tests authentication and data fetching

3. **`src/app/api/bids/copart-integration-example.ts`** - Example integration
   - Shows how to modify your bid API
   - Copy relevant parts to your actual `route.ts`

### Day 4-5: Set Up Payment Processing

While waiting for API access, set up payments:

```bash
# You'll need these for production
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

1. Sign up at https://paystack.com
2. Get test API keys
3. Implement payment escrow system

---

## When You Get API Access (Week 2)

### Step 3: Test Connection

Run the test script I created:
```bash
# Install dotenv if needed
npm install dotenv

# Run test
npx tsx scripts/test-copart-connection.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Authentication successful!
✅ Found 5 vehicles
✅ Got details for 2018 Toyota Camry
🎉 All tests passed!
```

**If it fails:**
- Check credentials in .env
- Verify API key is activated
- Read Copart's API documentation
- Update `copart-api.ts` to match their format

### Step 4: Customize API Client

Once you understand Copart's API structure:

1. Open `src/lib/copart-api.ts`
2. Update the authentication method (OAuth, Basic Auth, etc.)
3. Update endpoint URLs
4. Test each function individually
5. Handle their specific response formats

### Step 5: Implement Vehicle Sync

Create a background job to sync vehicles:

```typescript
// src/jobs/sync-vehicles.ts
import { createCopartClient } from '@/lib/copart-api';
import { db } from '@/db';
import { vehicles } from '@/db/schema';

export async function syncCopartVehicles() {
  const copartClient = createCopartClient();
  
  const result = await copartClient.searchVehicles({
    // Focus on vehicles suitable for Nigerian market
    makes: ['Toyota', 'Honda', 'Lexus', 'Mercedes', 'BMW'],
    years: [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023],
    limit: 100,
  });
  
  for (const vehicle of result.vehicles) {
    await db.insert(vehicles).values({
      auctionSource: 'copart',
      lotNumber: vehicle.lotNumber,
      vin: vehicle.vin,
      year: vehicle.year,
      make: vehicle.make,
      model: vehicle.model,
      trim: vehicle.trim,
      currentBid: vehicle.pricing.currentBid.toString(),
      // ... map all fields
    }).onConflictDoUpdate({
      target: vehicles.lotNumber,
      set: {
        currentBid: vehicle.pricing.currentBid.toString(),
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      },
    });
  }
}

// Run every 15 minutes
setInterval(syncCopartVehicles, 15 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Step 6: Update Bid API

Modify your existing `/api/bids/route.ts`:

1. Import Copart client
2. After validation, place bid on Copart
3. Store external bid ID in database
4. Handle errors gracefully

See `src/app/api/bids/copart-integration-example.ts` for complete example.

### Step 7: Create Bid Monitor

Background job to check bid results:

```typescript
// src/jobs/monitor-bids.ts
import { createCopartClient } from '@/lib/copart-api';
import { db } from '@/db';
import { bids } from '@/db/schema';
import { eq, isNotNull } from 'drizzle-orm';

export async function monitorBids() {
  const copartClient = createCopartClient();
  
  // Get all bids with external IDs that are pending
  const pendingBids = await db
    .select()
    .from(bids)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(bids.status, 'pending'),
        isNotNull(bids.externalBidId)
      )
    );
  
  for (const bid of pendingBids) {
    const status = await copartClient.getBidStatus(bid.externalBidId!);
    
    if (status.status !== bid.status) {
      // Update status
      await db.update(bids)
        .set({
          status: status.status,
          finalBidAmount: status.currentBid.toString(),
          lastSyncedAt: new Date(),
        })
        .where(eq(bids.id, bid.id));
      
      // Send notification
      if (status.status === 'won') {
        await sendWinNotification(bid.userId, bid.vehicleId);
      }
    }
  }
}

// Run every 5 minutes
setInterval(monitorBids, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```
