## 🔐 Environment Variables Needed for Production

### Critical (Must Have)
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
JWT_SECRET=<strong-secret>
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
TERMII_API_KEY=...
```

### Important (Should Have)
```env
CARFAX_API_KEY=...
NMVTIS_API_KEY=...
BROKER_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=...
```

### Optional (Nice to Have)
```env
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=...
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=...
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: PostgreSQL (should be running)
   # Terminal 2: Redis
   redis-server
   
   # Terminal 3: Next.js dev server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with Seed Data**
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   # Login: emeka@example.com / password123
   ```

3. **View Database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Placeholder Integrations**
   - Email/SMS/WhatsApp notifications log to console only
   - No real auction data (needs broker API)
   - Exchange rates are hardcoded
   - Vehicle images are from Unsplash (placeholder)

2. **Security**
   - No rate limiting yet
   - No CSRF protection
   - No input sanitization (beyond Zod validation)
   - JWT secret should be rotated

3. **Performance**
   - No caching strategy yet
   - No CDN for images
   - No database query optimization
   - No lazy loading on frontend

## 🚀 Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. ✅ **Test current implementation** - Use seed data to verify all features
2. 🔧 **Set up payment gateway** - Start with Paystack (most critical)
3. 📧 **Configure notifications** - SendGrid for emails, Termii for SMS
4. 🔐 **Implement KYC verification** - Essential for production
5. 📊 **Build admin dashboard** - Monitor operations
6. 🌐 **Integrate broker API** - Get real auction data
7. 🧪 **Testing** - Write tests for critical paths
8. 🚢 **Deploy to staging** - Test in production-like environment
