# Quick Answer: Copart Scraping & Proxy Bidding

## Your Questions Answered

### Q1: Is it possible to scrape data from Copart?
**Answer: YES, technically possible, but STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED**

‚ùå **Why NOT to scrape:**
- Violates Copart Terms of Service (legal liability)
- Gets your IP permanently banned
- Can't access authenticated features (like bidding)
- Breaks frequently when site updates
- Unreliable data quality
- 30-50% failure rate
- 2-5 seconds per page (very slow)

‚úÖ **Better alternatives:**
1. **Data Broker** (AutoData Direct, DataOne) - $300/month, legal, reliable
2. **Official Copart Dealer Account** - $5,000 deposit, professional, lower fees

### Q2: Can we place bids by proxy for our clients?
**Answer: YES - This is exactly your business model!**

‚úÖ **What you need:**
- Official API access (via broker OR dealer account)
- Client authorization/KYC
- Payment processing
- Bid monitoring system

‚úÖ **Your current implementation:**
- You already have the bid UI and database
- Just need to connect to real Copart API
- Code template created in `src/lib/copart-api.ts`
